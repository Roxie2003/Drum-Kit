# Drum-Kit 🥁

Drum kit is a beginner friendly project that allows you to play drums on the browser.

It has a number of keys on the webpage representing different drums in a typical drum set. 

When you click on any of the keys, you’ll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And you can press them as many times as you want.

Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
